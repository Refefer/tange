Tange
---

Tange is a Task-based parallelization library written for Rust.  It currently comes with two flavors:

1. Tange-core: This contains the primitives for constructing and executing a Task graph
2. Tange-collection: This contains a higher level Dataflow interface for convenient munging of data.
