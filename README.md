Tange
---

Tange is a Task-based parallelization library written for Rust.  It currently comes with two flavors:

1. [tange-core](tange-core): This contains the primitives for constructing and executing a task graphs
2. [Tange-collection](tange-collection): This contains a higher level Dataflow interface for convenient munging of data.
